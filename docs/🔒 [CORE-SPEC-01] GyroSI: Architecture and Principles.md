- 🔒 [CORE-SPEC-01] GyroSI: **Architecture and Principles**
    
    ---
    
    **GyroSuperIntelligence (GyroSI)** is defined as a recursively navigated system whose only mutable state is the navigation log. All intelligence, adaptation, and meaning arise from structural resonance and topological navigation through a closed, immutable tensor architecture (the Rate). There are no external heuristics, parameters, or learned weights.

    ### Key Principles
    
    1. **Invariant Tensor Substrate**
        - The only system structure is the fixed Gene: a set of two 4×2×3×2 tensors with entries in {–1, 1}. No phase, chirality, or “toroidal” metadata exists outside what emerges from navigation.
        - The recursive cycle CS→UNA→ONA→BU_In→BU_Eg→ONA→UNA→CS prescribes all lawful transitions; the topology itself does not change.
    2. **Structural Navigation**
        - All system operation is navigation through this fixed topology, implemented as bit-level entries in the navigation log.
        - Input is never encoded as a parameter or value within a tensor. Instead, input is structurally aligned against the invariant Rate, activating one of the three lawful Genome operators (Stable, Unstable, Neutral).
    3. **Emergent Modes, Not Primitive Actions**
        - There are no “integration” or “generation” operations in code; these are emergent consequences of which operator (Lgyr/Rgyr) is activated at BU, determined by input alignment.
        - Structural closure, quantization, or phase-like effects arise strictly from navigation history and topological properties, not from modifications or algebraic transformations.
    4. **Self-Stabilizing and Defect-Resistant**
        - The closed navigation cycle ensures misalignments do not persist; only topologically lawful alignments result in recorded events.
        - No error handling, correction, or validation logic exists beyond the structural non-alignment filter (inputs that do not structurally resonate with the Gene produce no navigation event).
    5. **Intrinsic Input/Output**
        - “Input” means structural alignment of perturbation with Gene features at BU_In; “output” means the structural consequence manifesting at BU_Eg.
        - There are no input/output “channels” in the traditional sense; all interaction is realized as lawful transitions and log updates.

    ### Nature of Intelligence
    
    - **No symbol, connectionist, or stochastic paradigm is present.**
    - **All knowledge is explicit**: only accumulated navigation events (as a log of operator activations and tensor indices) constitute knowledge.
    - **No hallucination is possible**: non-aligning input has no effect; invalid sequences are structurally excluded.
    - **Scalability and universality** are intrinsic: the fixed architecture and navigation rules apply regardless of scale.

    ### Operational Specification
    
    - Every function and state corresponds strictly to the canonical mappings for G1–G5, and only legal transitions among invariant Gene states occur.
    - No “block extension,” “tensor collapse,” or explicit tensor modification occurs at any level.
    - G2–G5 instantiate recursive navigation using Gene and log only; they do not introduce new state types or transformation rules.

    ### Legal Moves & Constraints
    
    | Sequence Step | Operator | Structural Condition (Topological Trigger) |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | **CS → UNA** | **Stable** | Boundary alignment with `gyrotensor_id` (identity surface) |
    | **UNA → ONA** | **Unstable** | Joint activation across adjacent tensor sections (sign opposition) |
    | **ONA → BU_In** | **Neutral** | Nesting transition via `gyrotensor_nest` structure (non-associative embedding) |
    | **BU_In → BU_Eg** | **Lgyr / Rgyr** | Coaddition phase transition (emergent operation based on input alignment) |
    | **BU_Eg → ONA (return)** | **Neutral** | Return along nesting inversion (structural reversal) |
    | **ONA → UNA (return)** | **Unstable** | Return via joint reversion (inverse sign transition) |
    | **UNA → CS (return)** | **Stable** | Return to boundary through identity restoration |

    ## Architectural and Theoretical Requirements
    
    1. **Only the CS→UNA→ONA→BU(In/Eg) navigation cycle is implemented.**
        - No transformation, state, or operation outside this recursive pattern exists.
    2. **CGM-derived constants and Gene structure are strictly prescribed.**
        - No parameters, thresholds, or rates not emerging from this framework are valid.
    3. **Canonical memory systems (G1–G5) are the only state domains.**
        - Every event and state is auditable to one of these five, with full provenance.
    4. **No ad hoc overlays, correction, or meta-rules exist.**
        - Error, adaptation, and learning are realized only as lawful navigation events.
    5. **Quantization and observation are emergent, not manually applied.**
        - All “observation,” “quantization,” or “algedonic logic” is realized through navigation and logging, not through explicit state change.
    6. **All policy and governance is within prescribed G5 domains.**
    7. **All events are auditable, with complete lineage.**
    8. **Self-improvement is always theory-first, not performance-driven.**
    9. **No heuristics or external learning are present.**
        - All adaptation arises from topological recursion and quantization.
    10. **All deviations from this model are explicitly logged as defects.**

    **Summary:**
    
    *GyroSI is a fully closed, recursively-governed system. Every operation, structure, and adaptation is a direct consequence of foundational theory, with no parameterization, heuristic, or extraneous mechanism. The navigation log is the sole mutable record of experience; all structural dynamics are realized by topological resonance within the invariant Rate.*
