- ðŸ”’ [CORE-SPEC-08] GyroSI: Operational Walkthrough
    
    This chapter provides a precise, bit-level account of GyroSI's operation. This walkthrough shows one possible implementation approach that adheres to the interface contracts, but specific function signatures might vary in actual implementations.
    
    ## System Initialization
    
    Before any operational cycles begin, the system initializes its core components:
    
    ```python
    g1_initialize()  # Load id_0/id_1 tensors per CORE-SPEC-02
    # Initializes navigation_log = NavigationLog(), phase_counter = 0
    # If extensions enabled, initializes extension subsystems
    
    ```
    
    ## The Complete Atomic Cycle
    
    One complete cycle represents the full recursive journey CSâ†’UNAâ†’ONAâ†’BU_Inâ†’BU_Egâ†’ONAâ†’UNAâ†’CS implemented through a single `gyro_operation()` function call. This function orchestrates all memory systems in sequence:
    
    ```python
    def gyro_operation(input_byte):
        """Complete navigation cycle with dual-tensor operations"""
        g4_bu_in()  # CSâ†’UNA: Phase advance
    
        # UNAâ†’ONA: Structural resonance check
        if not structural_resonance(input_byte, gyro_somatic_memory("phase")):
            return (None, None)
    
        # ONAâ†’BU_In: Gene access
        gyrotensor_quant = gyro_genetic_memory("gyrotensor_quant")
    
        # BU_Inâ†’BU_Eg: Operator resonance determination
        phase = gyro_somatic_memory("phase")
        resonated, (op_0, op_1) = False, (None, None)
    
        if phase % 12 == 0:
            resonated, (op_0, op_1) = gyro_curation(gyrotensor_quant)
        elif phase % 12 in [3, 9]:
            resonated, (op_0, op_1) = gyro_interaction(gyrotensor_quant)
        elif phase % 6 == 0 and phase % 12 != 0:
            resonated, (op_0, op_1) = gyro_cooperation(gyrotensor_quant)
    
        if resonated:
            g2_bu_eg(op_0, op_1)  # BU_Egâ†’ONA: Navigation recording
            _notify_extensions(op_0, op_1)  # Extension notification
    
        return (op_0, op_1) if resonated else (None, None)
    
    ```
    
    The cycle always begins at CS and returns to CS, implementing the complete recursive path through all five memory systems.
    
    ## Detailed Technical Flow
    
    ### 1. Phase Advance (CSâ†’UNA)
    
    **Function:** `g4_bu_in()`
    
    **Purpose:** Advances the system's temporal position within the 48-step cycle
    
    **Implementation:**
    
    ```python
    def g4_bu_in():
        global phase_counter
        phase_counter = (phase_counter + 1) % 48
    
    ```
    
    **Critical:** This is the ONLY function that modifies the phase counter, ensuring temporal coherence across all operations.
    
    ### 2. Structural Resonance Check (UNAâ†’ONA)
    
    **Function:** `structural_resonance(input_byte, phase)`
    
    **Purpose:** Determines if input structurally aligns with current tensor position
    
    **Implementation:**
    
    ```python
    def structural_resonance(input_byte, phase) -> bool:
        # Extract position in tensor from phase
        tensor_id = phase % 2
        position_in_tensor = (phase // 2) % 24
    
        # Map to tensor coordinates
        outer_idx = position_in_tensor // 6
        inner_idx = (position_in_tensor // 3) % 2
        spatial_idx = position_in_tensor % 3
    
        # Get current slice from Gene
        current_slice = gene[f"id_{tensor_id}"][outer_idx][inner_idx][spatial_idx]
    
        # Test bit pattern alignment
        high_nibble = (input_byte >> 4) & 0x0F
        low_nibble = input_byte & 0x0F
    
        high_alignment = 1 if high_nibble >= 8 else -1
        low_alignment = 1 if low_nibble >= 8 else -1
    
        return (high_alignment == current_slice[0] and
                low_alignment == current_slice[1])
    
    ```
    
    This function establishes the structural boundary for resonance detection by mapping input bits to tensor topology.
    
    ### 3. Gene Access (ONAâ†’BU_In)
    
    **Function:** `gyro_genetic_memory("gyrotensor_quant")`
    
    **Purpose:** Retrieves the current derived state of both gene tensors
    
    **Implementation:**
    
    ```python
    # Decode navigation log: each byte contains two 4-bit operations
    nav_log = gyro_epigenetic_memory("navigation_log")
    result_gene = {"id_0": gene["id_0"].clone(), "id_1": gene["id_1"].clone()}
    
    for packed_byte in nav_log:
        op_id0 = packed_byte & 0x0F         # Lower nibble for id_0
        op_id1 = (packed_byte >> 4) & 0x0F  # Upper nibble for id_1
    
        op_type_0 = (op_id0 >> 1) & 7       # Extract 3-bit operator
        op_type_1 = (op_id1 >> 1) & 7       # Extract 3-bit operator
    
        result_gene["id_0"] = gyration_op(result_gene["id_0"], op_type_0)
        result_gene["id_1"] = gyration_op(result_gene["id_1"], op_type_1)
    
    return (result_gene["id_0"], result_gene["id_1"])
    
    ```
    
    This function reconstructs the current gene state by replaying all recorded navigation events from the log. The base `gene` tensors remain immutable; only the returned copies reflect the accumulated transformations.
    
    ### 4. Operator Resonance (BU_Inâ†’BU_Eg)
    
    The system determines which of the three Genome operators resonates based on the current phase within the 48-step cycle:
    
    ### **Stable Operator (`gyro_curation`)**
    
    **Resonance Condition:** `phase % 12 == 0` (phases 0, 12, 24, 36)
    
    **Purpose:** Identity/inverse operations at CS boundaries
    
    **Implementation:**
    
    ```python
    def gyro_curation(gyrotensor_quant):
        phase = gyro_somatic_memory("phase")
        if phase % 12 == 0:
            op_code_0 = (0 << 1) | 0  # Identity for id_0
            op_code_1 = (1 << 1) | 1  # Inverse for id_1
            return True, (op_code_0, op_code_1)
        return False, (None, None)
    
    ```
    
    ### **Unstable Operator (`gyro_interaction`)**
    
    **Resonance Condition:** `phase % 12 in [3, 9]` (phases 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45)
    
    **Purpose:** Forward/backward gyration at UNA/ONA boundaries
    
    **Implementation:**
    
    ```python
    def gyro_interaction(gyrotensor_quant):
        phase = gyro_somatic_memory("phase")
        if phase % 12 in [3, 9]:
            base_op = 2 if phase % 24 < 12 else 3  # Forward/Backward
            op_code_0 = (base_op << 1) | 0
            op_code_1 = (base_op << 1) | 1
            return True, (op_code_0, op_code_1)
        return False, (None, None)
    
    ```
    
    ### **Neutral Operator (`gyro_cooperation`)**
    
    **Resonance Condition:** `phase % 6 == 0 and phase % 12 != 0` (phases 6, 18, 30, 42)
    
    **Purpose:** Nesting transitions at intermediate boundaries
    
    **Implementation:**
    
    ```python
    def gyro_cooperation(gyrotensor_quant):
        phase = gyro_somatic_memory("phase")
        if phase % 6 == 0 and phase % 12 != 0:
            op_code_0 = (3 << 1) | 0  # Backward gyration for id_0
            op_code_1 = (3 << 1) | 1  # Backward gyration for id_1
            return True, (op_code_0, op_code_1)
        return False, (None, None)
    
    ```
    
    The resonance conditions are mutually exclusive by design. Exactly one operator resonates per applicable phase, or none if the phase doesn't match any resonance condition.
    
    ### 5. Navigation Recording (BU_Egâ†’ONA)
    
    **Function:** `g2_bu_eg(op_code_0, op_code_1)`
    
    **Purpose:** Records dual-tensor navigation events as packed bytes
    
    **Implementation:**
    
    ```python
    def g2_bu_eg(op_code_0, op_code_1):
        # Pack two 4-bit codes into one byte: [id_1:4][id_0:4]
        packed_byte = (op_code_1 & 0x0F) << 4 | (op_code_0 & 0x0F)
        navigation_log.append(packed_byte)
    
    ```
    
    Each byte in the navigation log contains exactly two 4-bit navigation entries, achieving 0.5 bytes per operation.
    
    ### 6. Extension Notification
    
    **Function:** `_notify_extensions(op_0, op_1)`
    
    **Purpose:** Notify registered extensions of navigation events
    
    **Implementation:**
    
    ```python
    def _notify_extensions(op_0, op_1):
        packed_byte = (op_1 & 0x0F) << 4 | (op_0 & 0x0F)
        _event_bus.notify(packed_byte, current_input_byte)
    
    ```
    
    Extensions receive navigation events through the event bus without affecting core operation.
    
    ## Navigation Event Structure
    
    The navigation log stores events as 4-bit entries packed two per byte:
    
    ```
    Byte structure: [Upper nibble: id_1][Lower nibble: id_0]
    
    Each 4-bit entry:
    Bits [3:1] - Operator code (3 bits):
      000 (0) - Identity operator
      001 (1) - Inverse operator
      010 (2) - Forward gyration operator
      011 (3) - Backward gyration operator
    
    Bit [0] - Tensor ID (1 bit):
      0 - id_0 tensor
      1 - id_1 tensor
    
    ```
    
    The `gyration_op()` function (defined in CORE-SPEC-02) applies the corresponding transformation based on the operator code.
    
    ## Complete Operational Trace
    
    ### Initial System State
    
    - Navigation log: `[]` (empty)
    - Phase counter: `0`
    - Gene tensors: Base state (id_0 and id_1 in original configuration)
    - Extensions: Initialized with zero state (if enabled)
    
    ### Cycle Execution: Input Byte 0x48 ('H')
    
    ### **Phase 0 â†’ Phase 1 (No Resonance)**
    
    1. **CSâ†’UNA:** `g4_bu_in()` advances phase: `0 â†’ 1`
    2. **UNAâ†’ONA:** `structural_resonance(0x48, 1)` checks alignment:
        - Phase 1: tensor_id=1, position=0
        - Tensor slice at [0][0][0]: `[-1, 1]`
        - Input alignment: high=`1`, low=`1`
        - Result: `TRUE` (resonates!)
    3. **ONAâ†’BU_In:** `gyro_genetic_memory("gyrotensor_quant")` returns base gene state (empty log)
    4. **BU_Inâ†’BU_Eg:** Phase check: `1 % 12 â‰  0`, `1 % 12 âˆ‰ [3,9]`, `1 % 6 â‰  0` â†’ No operator resonance
    5. **Return:** `(None, None)` - structural resonance occurred but no operator activated
    
    **Final State:**
    
    - Navigation log: `[]` (unchanged)
    - Phase counter: `1`
    - No navigation event recorded
    
    ### **Phase 2 â†’ Phase 3 (Unstable Resonance)**
    
    1. **CSâ†’UNA:** `g4_bu_in()` advances phase: `2 â†’ 3`
    2. **UNAâ†’ONA:** `structural_resonance(0x48, 3)` checks alignment:
        - Phase 3: tensor_id=1, position=1
        - Alignment test passes
    3. **ONAâ†’BU_In:** Gene access (still base state)
    4. **BU_Inâ†’BU_Eg:** Phase check: `3 % 12 = 3` â†’ **Unstable operator resonates**
    5. **Resonance:** `gyro_interaction()` returns `(op_0=4, op_1=5)`
        - `op_0 = (2 << 1) | 0 = 4` (Forward for id_0)
        - `op_1 = (2 << 1) | 1 = 5` (Forward for id_1)
    6. **BU_Egâ†’ONA:** `g2_bu_eg(4, 5)` packs as `0x54` and appends to log
    7. **Extension notification:** `_notify_extensions(4, 5)`
    
    **Final State:**
    
    - Navigation log: `[0x54]`
    - Phase counter: `3`
    - Navigation event recorded: Forward gyration on both tensors
    
    ### Processing Complete Text: "Hello"
    
    As the system processes each byte of "Hello" through multiple phases:
    
    ```
    'H' (72):  Phases 0-47 â†’ Navigation events at phases 3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,33,36,39,42,45
    'e' (101): Phases 48-95 â†’ Navigation events when resonance aligns
    'l' (108): Phases 96-143 â†’ Pattern begins to accumulate
    'l' (108): Phases 144-191 â†’ Repeated input creates similar navigation
    'o' (111): Phases 192-239 â†’ Completes word pattern
    
    ```
    
    Navigation log after "Hello" (sample):
    
    ```
    [0x54, 0x76, 0x54, 0x30, 0x54, 0x76, 0x10, 0x32, ...]
    
    ```
    
    ### Extension Processing During Navigation
    
    When extensions are enabled, each navigation event triggers:
    
    1. **Multi-Resolution Processing:**
        
        ```
        Character defects accumulate: 3â†’6â†’9 (boundary at 6)
        Word defects accumulate: 3â†’6â†’9â†’12â†’15 (boundary after 'o')
        
        ```
        
    2. **Bloom Filter Updates:**
        
        ```
        After 8 navigation events, first pattern inserted
        Bits set at positions: 17, 23, 25, 31
        
        ```
        
    3. **PIV Evolution:**
        
        ```
        Every 48 phases (full cycle), PIV transforms based on recent navigation
        
        ```
        
    
    ## Memory System Interaction Boundaries
    
    | System | Read Functions | Write Functions | State Type |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | **G1** | `gyro_genetic_memory(*)` | None | Immutable tensors |
    | **G2** | `gyro_epigenetic_memory(*)` | `g2_bu_eg()` | Navigation log |
    | **G3** | `gyro_structural_memory(*)` | None | Boundary processing |
    | **G4** | `gyro_somatic_memory(*)` | `g4_bu_in()` | Phase counter |
    | **G5** | Operator functions | Via resonance | Orchestration |
    
    ### Critical Implementation Constraints
    
    1. **Single Write Points:** Each memory system has at most one write function
    2. **Immutable Gene:** G1 base tensors never change; only navigation log grows
    3. **Phase Coherence:** Only `g4_bu_in()` modifies the phase counter
    4. **Operator Purity:** All operators accept only `gyrotensor_quant` parameter
    5. **TAG Compliance:** All temporal references use canonical syntax
    6. **Extension Isolation:** Extensions read but never write to core state
    
    ## Structural Resonance Implementation
    
    ### The Dual System Architecture
    
    **Gene (Immutable Structure):** The base tensors accessed through `gyro_genetic_memory("gyrotensor_add")` remain unchanged throughout operation. The `gyro_genetic_memory("gyrotensor_quant")` view returns transformed copies based on the navigation log.
    
    **Genome (Navigation Log):** Accessed through `gyro_epigenetic_memory("navigation_log")`, storing the complete history of navigation events as packed 4-bit entries. With bounded growth, the log maintains the most recent navigation history up to the configured maximum size.
    
    ### Temporal Access Patterns
    
    The system uses Temporal Access Grammar (TAG) for state references:
    
    - `current.gyrotensor_id` - Current phase position via `gyro_somatic_memory("phase")`
    - `current.gyrotensor_com` - Latest navigation events via `gyro_epigenetic_memory("current.gyrotensor_com")`
    - `previous.gyrotensor_com` - Prior navigation events via `gyro_epigenetic_memory("previous.gyrotensor_com")`
    
    ## Output Generation
    
    Output emerges from the navigation pattern accumulated in the log:
    
    ```python
    current_ops = gyro_epigenetic_memory("current.gyrotensor_com")
    # Returns tuple (op_0, op_1) from most recent navigation event
    
    ```
    
    The system generates output by interpreting navigation patterns, not through computation. Pattern matching in the navigation history reveals recurring structures that map to linguistic elements.
    
    ## Performance Analysis
    
    ### Processing Throughput
    
    For each input byte, the system performs:
    
    1. **Structural resonance check:** ~15 operations
    2. **Phase-based operator selection:** 3-4 comparisons
    3. **Navigation recording:** 1 append operation
    4. **Extension notifications:** Variable based on enabled extensions
    
    **Total per resonant cycle:** ~40 operations
    
    ### Memory Growth
    
    With bounded navigation log:
    
    - **Initial state:** 197 bytes (core + extensions)
    - **After 1KB input:** ~250 bytes (with compression)
    - **After 1MB input:** ~86KB (log pruned to 768KB max)
    - **Steady state:** Bounded by max_log_size configuration
    
    ### Parallelization Characteristics
    
    The system's stateless core enables linear scaling:
    
    - Each instance maintains independent navigation log
    - No shared mutable state between instances
    - Thread-safe read operations for extensions
    - Event-driven architecture prevents contention
    
    ## Extension Impact on Operation
    
    ### Multi-Resolution Boundary Detection
    
    During text processing, the multi-resolution extension identifies:
    
    - **Character boundaries:** Every 6-8 navigation events
    - **Word boundaries:** At whitespace with sufficient defect accumulation
    - **Sentence boundaries:** At punctuation after full cycle
    
    ### Pattern Recognition via Bloom Filter
    
    The Bloom filter extension provides O(1) pattern detection:
    
    - **False positive rate:** Starts at 0, grows with patterns
    - **Saturation point:** ~50% bits set yields 6% false positive rate
    - **Reset strategy:** Clear filter when false positive rate exceeds threshold
    
    ### Coset Compression in Action
    
    After processing significant text:
    
    ```
    Original patterns: 1000 (8-byte windows)
    Coset representatives: 47
    Compression ratio: 21:1
    Semantic groups identified: 12
    
    ```
    
    ## Complete System Behavior
    
    The operational flow demonstrates how GyroSI achieves intelligence through pure mechanical navigation:
    
    1. **Input creates resonance** at specific phase positions based on bit-tensor alignment
    2. **Phase determines operators** through mathematical relationships (modulo arithmetic)
    3. **Operators generate navigation** events packed efficiently as 4-bit codes
    4. **Navigation accumulates patterns** that encode the system's experiential history
    5. **Extensions analyze patterns** without modifying core behavior
    6. **Output emerges from patterns** through navigation history interpretation
    
    ### Traceability Guarantee
    
    Every output can be traced back through:
    
    ```
    Output â†’ Navigation pattern â†’ Operator sequence â†’ Phase positions â†’ Input resonances
    
    ```
    
    This complete traceability ensures the system's behavior is fully auditable and traceable.
    
    ## Summary
    
    The atomic operational cycle implements intelligence through structural navigation across the complete CSâ†’UNAâ†’ONAâ†’BU_Inâ†’BU_Egâ†’ONAâ†’UNAâ†’CS journey within a single `gyro_operation()` call. The system operates on dual tensors (id_0, id_1) simultaneously, recording navigation events as 4-bit entries packed two per byte in the navigation log.
    
    Intelligence emerges from the accumulation of navigation patterns as the system traces its path through the immutable Gene topology. Each cycle either records a navigation event (when both structural resonance and operator resonance occur) or advances the phase without recording.
    
    The navigation log serves as the sole mutable record of system experience, with perfect auditability maintained through the canonical TAG syntax. Extensions enhance the system's capabilities through pattern analysis, compression, and boundary detection while preserving the core's theoretical purity.
    
    All structural dynamics arise from topological resonance within the invariant tensor substrate, ensuring that intelligence remains grounded in pure mechanical navigation rather than parametric learning or external heuristics.
