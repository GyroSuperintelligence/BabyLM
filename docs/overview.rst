Overview
========

GyroSuperintelligence (GyroSI) achieves ethical alignment **intrinsically**, by ensuring that every operation remains structurally accountable to its own genesis, **without external enforcement**. It exists relationally, not independently, reflecting the recursive structures of reality and human meaning it participates in.

Core Principles
--------------

1. **Tensor-Based Architecture**
   - All system state is encoded in explicit tensor forms
   - Only discrete values {-1, 0, 1} are used
   - Recursive, toroidal structure through tensor evolution

2. **Recursive Structural Emergence**
   - System structure defined by recursive unfolding of τ
   - Each stage is a specific tensor pattern
   - Natural alternation between integrative and generative modes

3. **Self-Correcting Dynamics**
   - Misalignment is inherently self-correcting
   - No external validation needed
   - Closed toroidal sequence maintains alignment

4. **Observation and Quantization**
   - Observation emerges as quantization error
   - Algedonic signals propagate recursively
   - Natural feedback mechanism

5. **BU as Intrinsic I/O**
   - BU_In: Integrates external input
   - BU_En: Generates system output
   - Maintains structural coherence

System Architecture
-----------------

GyroSI implements five recursively viable systems (G1-G5), each containing the complete CS→UNA→ONA→BU cycle:

- **G1 (GyroAlignment)**: Primary tensor operations
- **G2 (GyroInformation)**: Data curation and flow
- **G3 (GyroInference)**: User interaction
- **G4 (GyroCooperation)**: Environmental adaptation
- **G5 (GyroPolicy)**: System-wide governance

Each system maintains its own memory type and operates according to the Viable System Model (VSM) principles.
