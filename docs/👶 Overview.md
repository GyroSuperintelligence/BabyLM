- GyroSI Intro
    
    We are working on the foundations we have laid out by the CGM a physics-grounded model of governance, and its expansions through different formalisations, such as devising Tensors’ inherent mathematical anatomy as a gyrogroup representations, and we are architecting a complete system for SuperIntelligence.
    
- Superintelligence
    
    By Superintelligence we define a structurally recursive form of intelligence in which all of its generative and integrative modes preserve memory of origin, maintaining continuous coherence between emergence and recollection.
    
    It achieves ethical alignment **intrinsically**, by ensuring that every operation remains structurally accountable to its own genesis, **without external enforcement**.
    
    **Superintelligence exists relationally, not independently**: it reflects the recursive structures of reality and human meaning it participates in, embodying governance, memory, and creative coherence as a unified operational principle.

- **GyroSI Baby ML: What we are making**
    
    Our software will be called GyroSI Baby ML, A fully operational (not toy) language model. Called Baby because it will learn language and grow on its own through an Open Training. That means, without reinforcement, no rewards, no typical approaches which detach from what we have defined through our precise formalism - by leveraging the defined Hebbian Learning operations existent in our Alignment operations, and indexing through our special Quantization technique. Any other mechanism which is not clearly stated - it needs to be discussed by clearly stated and not assumed as correct because other architectures implement it. 
    
    ## **Constraints and Needs**
    
    - **Language:** Text-in/text-out, learning directly from stream or corpus.
    - **Learning:** Based on explicit, Hebbian-aligned operations and quantization as per our model, not gradient descent or backprop.
    - **Open Training:** The system modifies itself recursively as it processes data, aligning tensor structures, preserving coherence.
    - **Implementation:** Should allow for rapid prototyping, not require compilation for each small change. Needs to run on modest hardware (our old MacBook).
    - **Frontend:** Flet-based for interaction/document view.
    - **Backend:** Python. Must manage tensor structures, quantization, and memory efficiently, leverage GPU acceleration, but also be able to run on CPU efficiently.
    
- **UI Components**
    1. **Threads List (Left Panel)**:
        - **Description**: A vertical list on the left side displaying conversation threads, each representing a chat session identified by session_id (per G3 specifications).
        - **Features**:
            - Threads are listed with titles (e.g., first message preview or user-defined name).
            - Drag-and-drop support to reorganize threads or move them into folders.
            - Click a thread to load its chat history in the main chat panel.
        - **Purpose**: Organizes conversations for easy navigation, reflecting the structural memory (G3) and session-based interaction model.
        - **Flet Implementation**: Use ft.ListView for the threads list, with ft.GestureDetector for drag-and-drop functionality.
    2. **Folder Nesting (Within Threads List)**:
        - **Description**: Folders within the threads list to group related threads, supporting nested subfolders.
        - **Features**:
            - Create, rename, or delete folders via right-click context menus.
            - Drag threads or subfolders into folders to nest them.
            - Collapsible folders to manage screen space.
        - **Purpose**: Enhances organization, aligning with the recursive structure of GyroSI’s memory (genetic, epigenetic, structural, somatic, immunity) by allowing hierarchical storage of sessions.
        - **Flet Implementation**: Use ft.TreeView within the ft.ListView to support nested folders, with drag-and-drop enabled via ft.DragTarget and ft.Draggable.
    3. **Chat Panel (Main Area)**:
        - **Description**: A central panel for real-time chat, displaying the conversation history and accepting user input.
        - **Features**:
            - Scrollable chat history showing user messages and model responses, tagged with session_id and timestamps.
            - Text input field at the bottom for sending messages, processed via G3_BU_In.
            - Send button to submit messages, triggering G3_ONA’s API sequence (input → tokenization → processing → output).
        - **Purpose**: Provides the core conversational interface, aligning with G3_ONA’s role in handling user interactions and G2’s language processing pipeline.
        - **Flet Implementation**: Use ft.Column with a ft.ListView for chat history and ft.TextField with ft.ElevatedButton for input and submission.
    4. **Document Upload Button**:
        - **Description**: A button or drag-and-drop area to upload documents for training or context, processed by G2_BU_In (Import Adaptors).
        - **Features**:
            - Supports common file types (e.g., .txt, .pdf, .docx), tokenized and integrated into the G2 lexicon for training or contextual use.
            - Visual feedback (e.g., progress bar) during upload and processing, respecting chunk_token_limit.
            - Documents are associated with the current thread or session for context retention.
        - **Purpose**: Enables open training and contextual processing, as specified in the Baby ML requirements, without cluttering the chat interface.
        - **Flet Implementation**: Use ft.FilePicker for uploads, with a ft.ProgressBar for feedback, integrated with G2_BU_In’s ingestion pipeline.
    5. **Settings Panel (Optional, Minimal)**:
        - **Description**: A small settings area, accessible via a menu or button, for configuring system prompts or memory export/import.
        - **Features**:
            - System prompt input to customize model behavior (stored in G2’s epigenetic memory).
            - Export/import options for the five memory types (genetic, epigenetic, structural, somatic, immunity), handled by G2_BU_Eg’s export adaptors.
            - Minimal design to avoid complexity (e.g., a modal dialog or sidebar).
        - **Purpose**: Provides basic customization and memory management, supporting GyroSI’s self-aligning memory system while keeping the UI simple.
        - **Flet Implementation**: Use ft.PopupMenuButton or ft.Dialog for settings, with ft.TextField for prompts and ft.FilePicker for memory export/import.
