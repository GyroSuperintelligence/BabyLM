📜 Added Missing Physics Functions (baby/governance.py)
exon_product_from_state(): Projects 48-bit state tensor to 8-bit exon product using theta and orbit size
propose_resonant_introns(): Converts exon product to candidate intron bytes using bit family coherence rules

📄 Updated PhenotypeEntry Contract (baby/contracts.py)
Removed conf: float field (confidence no longer stored)
Updated documentation to clarify that confidence is computed at runtime from physics
Maintained all other fields: mask, key, direction, _new

Changed from 12-byte to 9-byte format: <IIBHx → <IIB
Removed confidence storage (3 bytes saved per entry = 25% compression)
Updated _pack_phenotype() and _unpack_phenotype() functions
Format now stores only: state_idx, token_id, mask
🧠 Cleaned Learning Logic (baby/inference.py)
Removed confidence computation and storage from learn() method
Updated _create_default_phenotype() to not include confidence
Modified legacy methods for compatibility (apply_confidence_decay, prune_low_confidence_entries)
Updated validate_knowledge_integrity() to work without stored confidence
Simplified manage_orbit_entropy() to use mask entropy instead of confidence

I have completed the systematic review and cleanup of all files in the baby directory. Here is a summary of the changes:
baby/contracts.py: Removed legacy fields related to confidence and decay from PreferencesConfig and ValidationReport.
baby/governance.py: No changes were needed, as this file was already clean.
baby/information.py: Replaced inefficient sampling-based token lookups with a proper trie-based implementation for find_tokens_by_intron_prefix and find_tokens_by_last_intron.
baby/policies.py: Removed the legacy _get_append_only_uncached and _get_with_file_seeking functions, which were no longer used. Also removed the unused _STRUCT_SIZE constant.
baby/inference.py: No changes were needed, as this file was already clean.
baby/intelligence.py: Removed the unused _generate_random_token method, the TokenSTT class, and the stream processing functions.
The entire baby directory is now cleaner, more efficient, and free of legacy code.
toys/communication/external_adapter.py: Updated path handling to use absolute paths, cleaned up legacy code, optimized streaming response, and enhanced error handling.
memories/memory_preferences.json: Removed legacy settings related to confidence decay and pruning to align with the current architecture.
toys/training/wikipedia_eng.py: Removed legacy confidence settings and Bloom filter references, ensuring consistency with the current architecture.
All changes have been made with attention to performance, reliability, and quality, adhering to PEP8 standards and ensuring no linter errors. If there are any further adjustments or additional files to review, please let me know.
