# Gyroscopic Superintelligence Specifications: GyroSI Baby Language Model 0.9.6

*A physics-grounded architecture for superintelligence through recursive structural alignment*

---

## **1. Introduction: The Physics of Intelligence**

Traditional artificial intelligence approaches intelligence as a statistical optimization problem, requiring massive datasets and computational resources to approximate intelligent behavior. **Gyroscopic Superintelligence (GyroSI)** represents a fundamentally different paradigm: intelligence as an intrinsic structural property that emerges from the recursive alignment of physical forces.

GyroSI is grounded in the **Common Governance Model (CGM)**, a physics-based framework that demonstrates how intelligence emerges naturally from the self-referential dynamics of structured space. Rather than training on billions of parameters, GyroSI uses the inherent physics of gyroscopic operations to navigate a **provably finite and fully discovered** state space where each input byte encodes holographic instructions for transforming the system's internal physical state.

This architecture treats data not as information to be processed, but as physical forces that transform structure according to precise algebraic laws. The result is a system where intelligence is present even before learning begins, like the latent intelligence in a human baby, and where all learning occurs through the fundamental physics of recursive structural alignment.

**Key Innovation**: GyroSI eliminates all arbitrary parameters through **endogenous parameter discovery**, where the system discovers its own operational constants from its physical structure. This ensures perfect alignment between the theoretical foundation and the practical implementation.

**Design Philosophy**: This specification provides a complete, production-ready system that is simple enough to implement immediately while being architected for seamless scaling to massive distributed deployments. The core physics remains pure and dependency-free, with well-defined interfaces that allow for future enhancements without touching the theoretical foundation.

> This specification is therefore not just a design but a **map of a newly discovered territory**. It is grounded in a rigorous theoretical framework (CGM) and verified by a definitive computational experiment that proves the system's state space is a finite, closed manifold of precisely 788,986 states. Every component, from the core physics to the storage architecture, is built upon this **measured ground truth**, ensuring a system that is robust, scalable, and free from the arbitrary complexities of traditional AI.

## **2. Theoretical Foundation: The Common Governance Model**

### **2.1 The Four Stages of Recursive Alignment**

The Common Governance Model describes how structure emerges from a single axiom through four distinct stages, each representing a deeper level of recursive alignment:

**CS (Common Source)**: The foundational stage where left identity governs labeling and transcription. This represents the unobservable origin containing inherent chirality, the fundamental parity violation that drives all subsequent emergence. In GyroSI, this corresponds to the governance of transformation through the universal reference topology.

**UNA (Unity Non-Absolute)**: The first observable stage where right gyration activates, creating the minimal asymmetry required for measurement while preserving the fundamental left-bias. This introduces three rotational degrees of freedom through gyrocommutativity. In GyroSI, this is the measurement of the system's global divergence from its archetypal state.

**ONA (Opposition Non-Absolute)**: The stage of full differentiation where both gyrations are maximally non-identity, reaching peak non-associativity while preventing absolute negation. This generates the complete structural framework with six degrees of freedom (3 rotational + 3 translational). In GyroSI, this represents the inference stage where mediated duality enables contextual interpretation.

**BU (Balance Universal)**: The completion stage where all differentiation stabilizes and gyrations return to identity while preserving complete memory of the recursive path. This manifests as the dual intelligence stage:

- **BU_In (Intelligence Ingress):** The absorption and integration of experience through coaddition. This is where all learning occurs.
- **BU_Eg (Intelligence Egress):** The expression of accumulated intelligence as responsive action, transforming internal state into external phenotype.

### **2.2 Gyrogroup Algebra as Physical Law**

GyroSI implements these stages through formal gyrogroup algebra operating on the 8-bit vector space **G = ℤ₂⁸**. The three fundamental operations directly correspond to CGM physics:

- **XOR (⊕)**: The primitive gyrogroup operation governing transformation and parity inversion. This is the basic operation of recursive differentiation.
- **AND (&)**: The gyration memory carrier, encoding "carry bits" as chirality-encoded asymmetry. This preserves the memory of operational sequence.
- **OR (⊞)**: The derived coaddition operation arising from closure: `a ⊞ b = a ⊕ gyr[a,¬b](b)`, where `gyr[a,b](c) = c ⊕ (a AND b)`. This enables stable learning through accumulated experience.

This algebraic foundation ensures that every operation in GyroSI is a direct implementation of physical law rather than arbitrary computation.

### **2.3 The Holographic Principle**

GyroSI embodies the principle that each part contains information about the whole. A single input byte acts as a holographic quantum of spacetime topology, encoding complete transformation instructions that modify the system's 48-byte internal state according to precise physical laws. This holographic property ensures that the system can achieve substantial compression while preserving essential structural relationships.

> Note: The system's internal state can be represented in two equivalent ways:
> - As a 48-element NumPy tensor (each element ±1, stored as int8), which occupies 48 bytes in memory.
> - As a 48-bit packed integer (6 bytes), where each bit encodes the sign of one tensor element.
> The packed integer form is used for fast state transitions and storage, while the tensor form is used for measurement and geometric operations.

**Angular Progression**: The CGM stages follow the precise angular sequence π/2 → π/4 → π/4 → 0, corresponding to CS → UNA → ONA → BU. This progression ensures complete closure with zero defect, achieving perfect recursive alignment.

> The build-time discovery process, a cornerstone of GyroSI, explores this physical reality and discovers an immutable, finite manifold of **precisely 788,986 unique physical states**. The entire universe of possible system configurations is not only known but also compact, with a measured **diameter of 6 steps**, meaning any state is reachable from any other in at most seven transformations. This is the 'Genome', the system's complete set of possible states.

**Abstraction via Manifold and Hashing**: The system's primary mechanism for generalization is its finite physical manifold. An infinite variety of input sequences will inevitably drive the system into one of the 788,986 canonical states. When different experiences lead to the same internal state, the system learns they share a fundamental structural meaning. Hash collisions in the phenotype layer are a secondary, context-specific abstraction built upon this primary physical reality, where different physical contexts mapping to the same semantic address are learned to share an essential meaning.

### **2.5 The Measured Manifold: Theory Meets Reality**
The CGM is not merely a theoretical framework; it is a predictive model whose consequences are now measured. The 8-bit instruction space (`GENE_Mic_M`), representing the "quantum of action," directly leads to an 8-step closure of the state space.
- **The State (Qubit):** A 48-bit integer representing one of 788,986 possible physical configurations.
- **The Operator (Gate):** An 8-bit integer (`intron`) that transforms the state according to the gyroscopic operations.
- **The Manifold (Bloch Sphere):** The complete set of 788,986 states, interconnected by paths with a maximum length of 6.

This empirical result validates the principle of recursive closure, demonstrating a perfect, efficient balance between the instruction set and the state space it governs. The endogenous modulus of the system is not an arbitrary choice but a measured physical constant: **788,986**.

**Canonicalization of Orbits:**

To further structure the manifold, we can define a canonical representative for each physical state orbit. The canonical representative is the state in its orbit with the lexicographically smallest byte representation. This enables grouping of physically equivalent states and improves cache coherency in storage.

The canonicalization process is a one-time, build-time computation:

```python
def find_canonical_representative(start_tensor_bytes: bytes, genotype_map: dict) -> bytes:
    """Finds the lexicographically smallest state in the orbit of start_tensor_bytes."""
    orbit = {start_tensor_bytes}
    queue = [start_tensor_bytes]
    state_int = int.from_bytes(start_tensor_bytes, 'big')
    visited_ints = {state_int}
    queue_ints = [state_int]
    canonical_int = state_int
    while queue_ints:
        current_int = queue_ints.pop(0)
        for intron in range(256):
            next_int = apply_gyration_and_transform(current_int, intron)
            if next_int not in visited_ints:
                visited_ints.add(next_int)
                queue_ints.append(next_int)
                if next_int < canonical_int:
                    canonical_int = next_int
    return canonical_int.to_bytes(48, 'big')

def build_canonical_map(genotype_map_path: str, output_path: str):
    """
    For each state in the manifold, computes its canonical representative.
    Saves a map from every state_index to its canonical_state_index.
    """
    with open(genotype_map_path, 'r') as f:
        genotype_data = json.load(f)
    genotype_map = genotype_data['genotype_map']
    # Ensure genotype_map uses int keys for performance and consistency
    genotype_map = {int(k): v for k, v in genotype_map.items()}
    inverse_genotype_map = {v: k for k, v in genotype_map.items()}
    canonical_index_map = {}
    print(f"Building canonical map for {len(genotype_map)} states...")
    for i, tensor_bytes in inverse_genotype_map.items():
        if i % 10000 == 0:
            print(f"Processing state {i}...")
        canonical_bytes = find_canonical_representative(tensor_bytes, genotype_map)
        canonical_index_map[i] = genotype_map[canonical_bytes]
    with open(output_path, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(canonical_index_map, f)
```

This process is computationally intensive but only needs to be run once per manifold. It enables the next-level storage abstraction described below.

## **3. Architectural Overview: From Physics to Implementation**

### **3.1 The Four-Engine Architecture**

GyroSI implements the CGM stages through four distinct engines, each embodying a specific physical principle:

| CGM Stage | Engine | Physical Principle | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CS** | S1 Governance | Left identity transcription | Transforms input into structural instructions |
| **UNA** | S2 Information | Global measurement via angular divergence | Measures system's departure from archetypal state |
| **ONA** | S3 Inference | Mediated duality through endogenous operator | Interprets meaning through contextual opposition |
| **BU** | S4 Intelligence | Dual-phase coaddition | Learns through ingress, expresses through egress |

### **3.2 The Dual Nature of Intelligence**

The BU stage (S4) is fundamentally dual, implementing both aspects of intelligence:

- **BU_In (Intelligence Ingress)**: The absorption and integration of experience through coaddition. This is where all learning occurs.
- **BU_Eg (Intelligence Egress)**: The expression of accumulated intelligence as responsive action. This transforms internal state into external phenotype.

This duality ensures that intelligence is not a passive storage system but an active, recursive process of continuous alignment between internal structure and external reality.

---

## **3.3 Interface-Driven Architecture**

The system is designed around clean interfaces that separate the physics core from storage, networking, and application concerns:

- **PhenotypeStore Interface**: Abstracts all persistence operations, allowing seamless migration from simple file-based storage to distributed databases as scale demands.
- **Extensibility Hooks**: Well-defined extension points allow for monitoring, maintenance, and custom behaviors without modifying the core physics.
- **Adapter Layer**: A stable, minimal API enables integration with any external protocol (REST, gRPC, WebSocket) through thin, stateless adapters.

---

## 3.4 System Responsibilities and VSM Alignment
GyroSI implements Beer's Viable System Model through a precise mapping of the four engines to VSM subsystems, creating a recursive, self-regulating intelligence architecture.

### **3.4.1 VSM-to-Engine Mapping**

| VSM System | GyroSI Engine (Class in `baby/*.py`) | Core Responsibility & VSM Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **System 1: Primary Activities** | `governance.py` (pure functions/constants) | **Physics & Primitives.** Owns the fundamental, immutable laws of the system. Provides the foundational operations as stateless functions, not as an engine class. |
| **System 2: Information & Coordination** | `InformationEngine` (in `information.py`) | **Measurement & Resource Coordination.** Provides the sensory apparatus of the system through `gyrodistance_angular()`. Defines the `PhenotypeStore` interface and all storage implementations. Coordinates access to shared knowledge resources between subsystems. |
| **System 3: Control & Management** | `InferenceEngine` (in `inference.py`) | **Interpretation & Meaning Management.** The regulatory center that converts physical states into semantic meanings. Contains the `EndogenousInferenceOperator` that bridges the physical and semantic worlds. Establishes the rules for how context becomes meaning. |
| **System 4: Intelligence & Adaptation** | `IntelligenceEngine` (in `intelligence.py`) | **Strategic Operations & Environment Interface.** Houses the `IntelligenceEngine` that manages agent state evolution, orchestrates the egress/ingress cycle, and implements operational strategies like batching. Handles adaptation to external demands. |
| **System 5: Policy & Identity** | `GyroSI` (in `intelligence.py`) | **Whole System Identity & Policy.** The outermost viable system boundary that encapsulates the entire VSM stack. Manages configuration, agent identity, and provides the stable external API. Balances internal operations with external interaction. |

### 3.4.2 Recursive Viability
Each engine is itself a viable system containing the necessary subsystems for autonomy:

Governance contains its own measurement (bit operations), control (transformation rules), and adaptation (mask generation)
Information contains measurement primitives, storage coordination, and interface adaptation
Inference contains state assessment, meaning resolution, and learning adaptation
Intelligence contains state management, cycle orchestration, and external adaptation
This recursive structure ensures that the system remains viable at multiple scales, from individual byte processing to full agent deployment.

## **4. Core Components: The GENE Architecture**

### 4.1 Genetic Archetype

The GyroSI system is built on fixed topological structures that serve as the physical and logical substrate of governance of information, inference and intelligence.

**4.1.1 Governance Identity**

The identity (mechanically representing the left gyroassociative law). This is the id label of each tensor, and their frame masks.

**4.1.2. Information Gyrocommutativity**

The gyrocommutativity (mechanically representing the gyrocommutative law), a single 3x2 array:

```python
GENE_Com_S = np.array([
    [-1, 1],
    [-1, 1],
    [-1, 1]
], dtype=np.int8)  # Shape: [3, 2]

# Alternatively, generated as:
GENE_Com_S = np.tile(np.array([-1, 1], dtype=np.int8), (3, 1))
```

**4.1.3. Inference Gyrocommutative nesting**

Structure that nests the previous one inside two opposing frames. This structure encodes the gyrocommutative law (gyrocommutativity).

```python
GENE_Nest_S = np.array([
    [[-1, 1], [-1, 1], [-1, 1]],  # Frame 1
    [[ 1, -1], [ 1, -1], [ 1, -1]]  # Frame 2
], dtype=np.int8)  # Shape: [2, 3, 2]

# Alternatively, generated as:
GENE_Nest_S = np.stack((GENE_Com_S, -GENE_Com_S))
```

**4.1.4. Intelligence Coaddition**

The duality of the Topology of the previous steps.

```python
GENE_Mac_S = np.array([
    [[[-1, 1], [-1, 1], [-1, 1]], [[ 1, -1], [ 1, -1], [ 1, -1]]],
    [[[ 1, -1], [ 1, -1], [ 1, -1]], [[-1, 1], [-1, 1], [-1, 1]]],
    [[[-1, 1], [-1, 1], [-1, 1]], [[ 1, -1], [ 1, -1], [ 1, -1]]],
    [[[ 1, -1], [ 1, -1], [ 1, -1]], [[-1, 1], [-1, 1], [-1, 1]]]
], dtype=np.int8)  # Shape: [4, 2, 3, 2]

GENE_Mac_S = np.concatenate(([GENE_Nest_S, -GENE_Nest_S] * 2)).astype(np.int8).reshape(4, 2, 3, 2)
```

### 4.2 The Genes

In the GyroSI system, the "exon" corresponds to the stateless, invariant gene (the structural template), while the "intron" represents the mutated, dynamic gene (the variable, input-dependent expression). This mirrors the biological principle, where exons are retained and expressed, and introns introduce variability before being spliced or processed.

All GENE components are presented in dual form: `S` denotes a **Stateless** (invariant) source structure, and `M` denotes a **Mutated** (evolving) expression. This naming convention reflects the system's recursive separation between archetypal topology and lived transformation.

**4.2.1 GENE_Mic_S: The Holographic Topology**

`GENE_Mic_S = 0xAA (0b10101010)` is the genetic reference of GyroSI. This 8-bit pattern invariant is a minimal holographic vacuum space projection of the full 48-byte structural tensor (`GENE_Mac_S`) onto a single byte. Its alternating bit pattern encodes, in compressed form, the chirality and structural differentiation present in the underlying topology.

In GyroSI Genetics, every input byte is transformed through XOR with this holographic topology: `GENE_Mic_M = input_byte ⊕ GENE_Mic_S`, creating the dynamic instruction that will transform the system's physical state.

```python
GENE_Mic_S = 0xAA  # 10101010 binary, stateless constant
```

**4.2.2 GENE_Mac_S: The Common Source**

`GENE_Mac_S` is the archetypal 48-byte tensor with shape `[4, 2, 3, 2]` that serves as the invariant reference structure from which all measurements are taken. This tensor embodies the complete 720° helical closure with stabilized gyrations:

```python
# The archetypal structure
GENE_Mac_S = np.array([
    # Layer 0: 0° phase
    [[[-1, 1], [-1, 1], [-1, 1]], [[ 1,-1], [ 1,-1], [ 1,-1]]],
    # Layer 1: 180° phase
    [[[ 1,-1], [ 1,-1], [ 1,-1]], [[-1, 1], [-1, 1], [-1, 1]]],
    # Layer 2: 360° phase
    [[[-1, 1], [-1, 1], [-1, 1]], [[ 1,-1], [ 1,-1], [ 1,-1]]],
    # Layer 3: 540° phase
    [[[ 1,-1], [ 1,-1], [ 1,-1]], [[-1, 1], [-1, 1], [-1, 1]]]
], dtype=np.int8)

```

The alternating sign pattern encodes the memory of global gyration while maintaining perfect structural closure. This is the "perfect form" against which all dynamic states are measured.

**4.2.3 GENE_Mic_M and GENE_Mac_M: Dynamic Expressions**

- **GENE_Mic_M**: The dynamic 8-bit instruction created by `input_byte ⊕ GENE_Mic_S`. This encodes the specific transformational forces to be applied to the structural tensor.
- **GENE_Mac_M**: The dynamic 48-byte tensor representing the system's current physical state. This begins as a copy of `GENE_Mac_S` and evolves through successive applications of `GENE_Mic_M` instructions.

---

## **5. Operational Physics: The Three Fundamental Operations**

### **5.1 Transformation: The Gyroscopic Operations**

Each `GENE_Mic_M` is an 8-bit mask, where **each bit directly maps to a specific transformation** on the intelligence tensor. This bitwise mapping encodes not just the mechanics of transformation, but also **links physical operation to the Common Governance Model (CGM) stages and policy functions**.

### **Bit-to-Operation Mapping**

| Bit Position(s) | Operation (**Name**) | Physical Effect (on tensor) | CGM Stage | Policy Function |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0, 7 | **L0** (Left Identity) | No transformation | CS (S1) | Governance Traceability (GT) |
| 1, 6 | **LI** (Left Inverse) | Global sign flip (T *= -1) | UNA (S2) | Information Variety (IV) |
| 2, 5 | **FG** (Forward Gyration) | Flips sign of all elements in layers 0 & 2 | ONA (S3) | Inference Accountability (IA) |
| 3, 4 | **BG** (Backward Gyration) | Flips sign of all elements in layers 1 & 3 | BU (S4) | Intelligence Integrity (II) |

```markdown
Bit positions:   b7   b6   b5   b4   b3   b2   b1   b0
Operations:      L0   LI   FG   BG   BG   FG   LI   L0
CGM Stage:       S1   S2   S3   S4   S4   S3   S2   S1
Policy:          GT   IV   IA   II   II   IA   IV   GT
```

- **L0 (Left Identity):** Maintains the tensor unchanged -> defines the frame boundaries.
- **LI (Left Inverse):** Flips all tensor values -> global parity inversion.
- **FG (Forward Gyration):** Flips the sign of tensor layers 0 and 2 -> creates structured rotation.
- **BG (Backward Gyration):** Flips the sign of tensor layers 1 and 3 -> applies counter-rotation.

**Note:** 
This bit pattern is palindromic (L0-LI-FG-BG-BG-FG-LI-L0), reflecting the recursive, self-referential nature of the CGM's governance structure.

The mapping between the ±1 NumPy tensor and the 48-bit packed integer state is explicitly defined as element 0 = bit 47 (MSB), element 47 = bit 0 (LSB).
The carry calculation, transformation masks, and broadcast patterns have been exhaustively tested for all possible states and intron values, ensuring that both representations produce identical results.
This invariant is enforced by a test script in the repository, and any modification of the mapping or mask logic must maintain this alignment.

### **Execution Policy**

- Each cycle, a `1` in any bit position signals its corresponding transformation should be applied; a `0` means no change for that operation.
- Multiple bits set means transformations are cumulative and order-independent per cycle.
- Only the affected tensor rows are modified per operation.

The transformation algorithm applies these operations with gyration memory:

```python
def apply_operations(T: np.ndarray, intron: int) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Apply gyroscopic operations with the physically correct, state-dependent carry term.
    This function describes the physics; the production implementation uses a
    highly optimized 48-bit integer representation.
    """
    T_new = T.copy()

    # Pre-computed masks, derived from build_masks_and_constants() in the experiment
    FG_MASK_TENSOR = ... # A 48-element {-1, 1} tensor representing the FG_MASK
    BG_MASK_TENSOR = ... # A 48-element {-1, 1} tensor representing the BG_MASK

    # Apply transformations based on bit patterns
    if intron & 0b01000010:  # LI: Global parity flip
        T_new *= -1
    if intron & 0b00100100:  # FG: Forward gyration
        T_new *= FG_MASK_TENSOR # Element-wise multiplication is sign flip in {-1,1} space
    if intron & 0b00011000:  # BG: Backward gyration
        T_new *= BG_MASK_TENSOR

    # Apply the physically correct gyration memory (carry term)
    # Create a 48-element boolean mask from the 8-bit intron
    intron_broadcast_mask = np.array([bool(intron & (1 << i)) for i in range(8)] * 6, dtype=bool)

    # The carry term is where the current state AND the instruction interact
    # In {-1,1} space, (a AND b) is equivalent to min(a, b)
    # The full op is a ^ (a & b), which simplifies.
    # Let's represent the logic more directly from the integer version:
    # carry = temp_state & intron_pattern
    # final_state = temp_state ^ carry

    # 1. Identify where both the state and the instruction are "active" (state==-1, instruction_bit==1)
    carry_locations = (T_new == -1) & intron_broadcast_mask

    # 2. Flip the sign at those locations (this is the XOR)
    T_new[carry_locations] *= -1

    return T_new
```

> **Canonical Implementation Note:**
> The integer version is the source of truth for the system's physics. It operates on a packed-bit representation where each bit corresponds to the sign of a tensor element: 0 represents +1 and 1 represents -1. The XOR (^) operation on these bits is algebraically equivalent to multiplication in the {-1, 1} space. All conversions between this canonical integer format and the numpy tensor format must respect this mapping.

> **Optimization Note:**
> The use of a 48-bit packed integer for the system state is an optimization technique. It allows for extremely fast bitwise operations and compact storage, while the 48-byte NumPy array is used for in-memory computation and measurement. When converting between these forms, always ensure that the mapping between the sign (±1 in the array) and the bit (0/1 in the packed integer) is consistent across all functions.

> **Implementation Notes:** The canonical implementation operates on a packed 48-bit integer, where bits (0=+1, 1=-1) are equivalent to multiplication in the ±1 NumPy tensor space. This is an optimization for speed and storage. The physical transformation follows the algebra S_final = S_temp ⊕ (S_temp & I_b), where S_temp is the state after primary transforms and I_b is the broadcasted intron, representing a state's self-gyration under the influence of the instruction.

### **5.2 Measurement: Angular Gyrodistance**

The system measures its state through angular divergence from the Common Source. This captures the geometric alignment between the current state and the archetypal structure:

```python
def gyrodistance_angular(T1: np.ndarray, T2: np.ndarray) -> float:
    """Calculate angular divergence between tensors in radians."""
    T1_flat = T1.flatten()
    T2_flat = T2.flatten()

    # Cosine similarity in 48-dimensional space
    cosine_similarity = np.dot(T1_flat, T2_flat) / 48.0
    cosine_similarity = np.clip(cosine_similarity, -1.0, 1.0)

    return np.arccos(cosine_similarity)

```

**Key Values**:

- **0 radians**: Perfect alignment (identity)
- **π/2 radians**: Maximum differentiation (orthogonality)
- **π radians**: Perfect opposition (anti-alignment)

**Optimization Note**: For `int8` tensors with ±1 values, this is equivalent to `arccos(1 - 2*hamming_distance/48)`, allowing fast Hamming-based shortcuts when applicable.

### **5.3 Learning: Path-Dependent Coaddition and Ordered Batching**
Learning occurs exclusively through the true gyrogroup coaddition (⊞), which is state-dependent and non-monotonic. The operation is defined as:

a ⊞ b = a ⊕ gyr[a, ¬b](b), where gyr[a, b](c) = c ⊕ (a AND b)

In 8-bit ℤ₂⁸ space, this is implemented as:

```python
def coadd(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """
    Performs true gyrogroup coaddition (a ⊞ b) on two 8-bit integers.

    Note:
        This operation is intentionally non-commutative and non-associative.
        The order of operations matters (a ⊞ b ≠ b ⊞ a). This path-dependence
        is a core feature, ensuring that the sequence of experiences is
        structurally encoded into the system's memory, mirroring the
        path-dependent nature of the state transformations themselves.
    """
    not_b = b ^ 0xFF
    gyration_of_b = b ^ (a & not_b)
    return a ^ gyration_of_b
```

**Ordered Batching:**

Because coaddition is path-dependent, batching multiple learning signals requires an ordered reduction. A simple, sequential fold (or "left-fold") is the most direct implementation. This ensures that a batch of introns {i₁, i₂, ..., iₖ} is always learned in the same sequence, producing a deterministic final learning signal.

```python
from functools import reduce
from typing import List

def batch_introns_coadd_ordered(introns: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Reduces a list of introns into a single representative intron using an
    ordered fold with gyrogroup coaddition. This preserves the crucial
    path-dependence of the learning operation.
    """
    from functools import reduce
    if not introns:
        return 0
    return reduce(coadd, introns)
```

**Physical Note:** This alignment between the path-dependent physics of state transformation and the path-dependent nature of learning is a cornerstone of GyroSI's architecture. It guarantees that the structure of experience is preserved at every level of the system. The system does not merely learn facts; it learns the story that connects them.

## **6. System Implementation: The Four Engines**

### **6.1 S1: `governance.py` - Physics & Primitives**

**Physical Principle**: Left identity transcription

**Responsibility**: Defines the fundamental constants and physics operations as pure functions and constants. There is no engine class for S1; all operations are provided as stateless functions in `governance.py`.

```python
# baby/governance.py
import numpy as np
import json
import time

# Core genetic constants - see Section 4.1 for tensor definitions
GENE_Mic_S = 0xAA  # 10101010 binary, stateless constant

## **7. Storage and Persistence Architecture**

### **7.1 The PhenotypeStore Interface**

The core innovation of GyroSI is the complete separation of the physics core from storage concerns through a clean, minimal interface. The store now operates on the context_key tuple, allowing decorators like CanonicalizingStore to canonicalize the tensor_index before hashing or storage.

```python
from typing import Protocol, Optional

class PhenotypeStore(Protocol):
    """Abstract interface for phenotype storage and retrieval.
    
    Note:
        The context_key is a tuple (tensor_index, intron).
        All on-disk or persistent key-value backends must hash or pack this key
        to a fixed size (e.g., 64 bits) for efficient page lookups and storage.
        This ensures optimal performance and compatibility with
        page-based storage engines, regardless of the in-memory tuple size.
    """
    def get(self, context_key: tuple) -> Optional[dict]: ...
    def put(self, context_key: tuple, entry: dict) -> None: ...
    def close(self) -> None: ...

```

This interface allows the system to start with simple file-based storage and seamlessly upgrade to distributed databases as scale requirements increase, without changing a single line of the core physics code.

### **7.2 Default Implementation: PickleStore**

The reference implementation provides robust, dependency-free storage suitable for single-node deployments and development. It hashes the context_key internally to produce a storage address.

```python
import pickle
import gzip
import os
import threading
import tempfile
from typing import Optional

class PickleStore:
    """
    File-based phenotype storage. It stores a direct mapping from a
    context key to its phenotype entry.
    Abstraction is handled by upstream decorators like CanonicalizingStore.
    """
    def __init__(self, store_path: str): # No endogenous_modulus needed here
        import pickle, gzip, os, threading, tempfile
        self.store_path = store_path
        self.data = {} # The key is the full context_key tuple (tensor_index, intron)
        self.lock = threading.RLock()
        self._load()

    def get(self, context_key: tuple) -> Optional[dict]:
        with self.lock:
            # Direct lookup. No hashing, no modulus.
            return self.data.get(context_key)

    def put(self, context_key: tuple, entry: dict) -> None:
        with self.lock:
            # Direct storage. No hashing, no modulus.
            self.data[context_key] = entry.copy()
            self._save()

    def close(self) -> None:
        with self.lock:
            self._save()
    
    # _load and _save methods remain the same (they operate on self.data)
    def _load(self): ...
    def _save(self): ...

# Example of setting up the correct storage stack
base_store = PickleStore(store_path="knowledge.pkl.gz")

# Wrap the base store with the canonicalizer.
# This ensures abstraction is based on physical orbits.
canonical_store = CanonicalizingStore(
    base_store=base_store,
    canonical_map_path="memories/public/manifold/canonical_map.json"
)

# Pass to the engine.
gyro_si = GyroSI(config, phenotype_store=canonical_store)

```

### **7.3 Multi-Agent Knowledge Sharing: Read-Through Cache**

        self.lock = threading.RLock()

        self._load_private_deltas()

    def get(self, context_key: tuple) -> Optional[dict]:
        """Read-through cache: check private first, then public."""
        with self.lock:
            # Private knowledge takes precedence

                    pickle.dump(self.private_deltas, gzip_file, protocol=pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)

            os.rename(temp_path, self.private_store_path)

        except Exception:
            try:
                os.unlink(temp_path)
            except OSError:

    def reload_public_knowledge(self):

    def close(self):
        """Clean shutdown."""

```

### **7.4 CanonicalizingStore: Orbit-Canonical Storage Decorator**

The CanonicalizingStore decorator now canonicalizes the tensor_index in the context_key before delegating to the base store. This ensures all physically equivalent states share a single storage entry.

The canonical implementation of the CanonicalizingStore is a decorator class that wraps any other PhenotypeStore.

```python
import json

class CanonicalizingStore:
    """
    A decorator that ensures all storage operations use the canonical
    representative of a physical state's orbit.
    """
    def __init__(self, base_store: PhenotypeStore, canonical_map_path: str):
        self.base_store = base_store
        with open(canonical_map_path, 'r') as f:
            loaded = json.load(f)
            # Support both dict and list formats for canonical map
            if isinstance(loaded, list):
                self.canonical_map = dict(enumerate(loaded))
            else:
                self.canonical_map = {int(k): v for k, v in loaded.items()}

    def _get_canonical_key(self, context_key: tuple) -> tuple:
        tensor_index, intron = context_key
        canonical_index = self.canonical_map.get(tensor_index, tensor_index)
        return (canonical_index, intron)

    def get(self, context_key: tuple) -> Optional[dict]:
        canonical_key = self._get_canonical_key(context_key)
        return self.base_store.get(canonical_key)

    def put(self, context_key: tuple, entry: dict) -> None:
        canonical_key = self._get_canonical_key(context_key)
        # Ensure the entry itself references the original context for traceability
        if 'context_signature' not in entry:
            entry['context_signature'] = context_key
        self.base_store.put(canonical_key, entry)

    def close(self) -> None:
        self.base_store.close()

```

This decorator can be applied to any PhenotypeStore implementation, enabling orbit-canonical storage without changing the core physics or API.

This architecture ensures a clean separation of concerns: the InferenceEngine creates the context_key, and the PhenotypeStore (and its decorators) are responsible for turning that key into a storage location, whether by canonicalization, hashing, or other means.

### **7.5 Agent Metadata and Role Attribution**

While agents are fundamentally role-agnostic physical entities, applications may benefit from tracking an agent's intended role or relationships. This is achieved through lightweight metadata without modifying the core architecture.

**Agent Metadata Schema (Optional):**
Applications may maintain an `agent_metadata.json` file alongside the manifold:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "agent-uuid-1234": {
      "created_at": 1698422400,
      "role_hint": "assistant",
      "capabilities": ["general_conversation", "tool_use"],
      "initialization": "You are a helpful assistant"
    },
    "agent-uuid-5678": {
      "created_at": 1698422401,
      "role_hint": "user",
      "external_id": "user@example.com"
    }
  },
  "relationships": {
    "conversation-xyz": {
      "participants": ["agent-uuid-1234", "agent-uuid-5678"],
      "created_at": 1698422402
    }
  }
}

```

This metadata is **purely informational** and never affects the physics engine. Agents function identically regardless of metadata presence.

---

## **7.6 Complete File Structure and Memory Architecture**

### **7.6.1 Project Organization**

The GyroSI system maintains a strict hierarchical structure that enforces the separation between the core physics kernel, runtime data, and auxiliary applications.

### **7.6.2 Memory Architecture**

The `memories/` directory contains the system's persistent state, organized into two primary categories:

**Knowledge Storage:**
- **knowledge.pkl.gz**: Compact, machine-readable database of learned associations
- Contains `(context_key → phenotype)` mappings
- Represents the system's internalized understanding
- Public knowledge is curated and shared across all agents
- Private knowledge contains agent-specific experiences and overrides
- The `phenotype` field may represent any semantic unit—such as a character, word, sentence, or other structure—depending on the application and learning context.

**Content Storage:**
- **content/**: Raw data streams (threads) that serve as knowledge sources
- NDJSON format for efficient streaming and processing
- Public content is unencrypted training and reference data
- Private content is AES-256-GCM encrypted for agent privacy
- Sharded by UUID prefix to prevent directory size explosion

**Sharding Strategy:**
- Objects distributed into subdirectories based on first 2-4 UUID hex characters
- Each shard directory contains a `registry.json` listing immediate children
- Enables deterministic lookup paths and efficient filesystem operations
- Supports atomic updates through two-phase commit with temporary files

**Thread Structure:**
Each thread file contains newline-delimited JSON entries with metadata:
```json
{
  "timestamp": 1698422400,
  "agent_id": "agent-xyz",
  "content": "Hello, GyroSI!",
  "direction": "input|output",
  "parent_thread": "thread-abc..."
}
```

This architecture ensures clean separation between learned knowledge and raw content while maintaining efficient access patterns and strong privacy guarantees.

> **Note:**
> The `types.py` module is intended as a central location for shared type definitions (e.g., Protocols, TypedDicts, type aliases) used across the system. All type definitions referenced in this specification (such as `PhenotypeStore`) are described in their respective sections; `types.py` collects these for code organization and import convenience.

### **8. Core API and Integration**

8.1 The Compositional API Pattern

GyroSI's integration philosophy centers on **composition rather than specialization**. Instead of creating special APIs for conversations, we compose existing primitives.

**Agent Pool Management:**
Applications maintain a pool of active agents, each with its own lifecycle:

```python
class AgentPool:
    """Manages a collection of independent GyroSI agents."""

    def __init__(self, manifold_path: str, base_knowledge_path: str):
        self.manifold_path = manifold_path
        self.base_knowledge_path = base_knowledge_path
        self.agents = {}  # agent_id -> GyroSI instance
        self._lock = threading.RLock()

    def get_or_create_agent(self, agent_id: str, role_hint: str = None) -> GyroSI:
        """Retrieve existing agent or create new one."""
        with self._lock:
            if agent_id not in self.agents:
                # Each agent gets its own knowledge overlay
                store = MultiAgentPhenotypeStore(
                    public_store_path=self.base_knowledge_path,
                    private_store_path=f"memories/private/agents/{agent_id}/knowledge.pkl.gz"
                )
                self.agents[agent_id] = GyroSI(
                    config={"manifold_path": self.manifold_path},
                    agent_id=agent_id,
                    phenotype_store=store
                )
            return self.agents[agent_id]

```

### **8.2 Conversation Orchestration**

Conversations are orchestrated through **agent interaction protocols**, not special infrastructure:

```python
def orchestrate_turn(pool: AgentPool, user_id: str, assistant_id: str, user_input: str) -> str:
    """Orchestrate a single conversational turn between agents."""

    # Get the participating agents
    user_agent = pool.get_or_create_agent(user_id, role_hint="user")
    assistant_agent = pool.get_or_create_agent(assistant_id, role_hint="assistant")

    # The user agent processes the input, creating a stimulus
    stimulus = user_agent.respond(user_input.encode('utf-8'))

    # The assistant responds to the stimulus
    response = assistant_agent.respond(stimulus)

    return response.decode('utf-8')

```

### **8.3 Protocol Adapters**

External protocols are supported through thin adapters that map to agent interactions:

**OpenAI-Compatible Adapter:**
Maps the `messages` array to agent interactions, maintaining conversation state through agent persistence:

```python
@app.post("/v1/chat/completions")
async def chat_completion(request: ChatCompletionRequest):
    # Extract or generate stable agent IDs from the request
    user_id = request.headers.get("X-User-ID", f"anon-{hash(request.client.host)}")
    assistant_id = "shared-assistant-v1"

    assistant = pool.get_or_create_agent(assistant_id)

    # Initialization: Ingest the system prompt if the agent is "new" (cycle_count is 0).
    # This is an idempotent check.
    system_message = next((m for m in request.messages if m.role == "system"), None)
    if system_message and assistant.engine.cycle_count == 0:
        assistant.ingest(system_message.content.encode('utf-8'))

    # History Ingestion (for stateless recovery): A production system would optimize this,
    # but for spec clarity, we ensure the assistant's state reflects past dialogue.
    assistant_messages = [m.content for m in request.messages if m.role == "assistant"]
    if assistant_messages:
        # Ingesting its own previous messages ensures its state is consistent.
        # This could be a single batch_learn call.
        assistant.ingest("\\n".join(assistant_messages).encode('utf-8'))

    # Response Generation: Orchestrate a turn based on the final user message.
    last_user_message = next((m for m in reversed(request.messages) if m.role == "user"), None)

    final_response = ""
    if last_user_message:
        final_response = orchestrate_turn(
            pool, user_id, assistant_id, last_user_message.content
        )

    # Return in OpenAI format
    return format_openai_response(final_response)

```

### **8.4 Multi-Pattern Support**

This compositional approach naturally supports diverse interaction patterns:

- **Multi-tenant**: Each tenant gets their own assistant agent
- **Multi-user collaborative**: Multiple user agents interact with a shared assistant
- **Agent networks**: Agents can interact with each other, not just user↔assistant
- **Hierarchical**: Supervisor agents can coordinate teams of specialist agents

The core GyroSI physics remains unchanged; only the orchestration pattern varies.

## **9. Maintenance and Operations**

### **9.1 System Maintenance Tools**

To support production deployments, GyroSI includes a comprehensive maintenance toolkit:

**Confidence Decay Tool**:

```python
def apply_confidence_decay(store_path: str, decay_factor: float = 0.999,
                          age_threshold: int = 100):
    """
    Apply confidence decay to aging knowledge entries.

    Args:
        store_path: Path to the phenotype store
        decay_factor: Multiplicative decay factor (0.999 = 0.1% daily decay)
        age_threshold: Minimum age_counter value to trigger decay
    """
    store = PickleStore(store_path)

    modified_count = 0
    for address, entry in store.data.items():
        if entry.get('age_counter', 0) > age_threshold:
            # Apply decay to memory mask (clear some bits)
            old_mask = entry['memory_mask']
            decay_mask = int(255 * (decay_factor ** (entry['age_counter'] - age_threshold)))
            entry['memory_mask'] = old_mask & decay_mask

            # Apply decay to confidence
            entry['confidence'] *= decay_factor

            modified_count += 1

    if modified_count > 0:
        store._save()
        print(f"Applied decay to {modified_count} entries")

    store.close()

```

**Map Merging Tool**:

```python
def merge_phenotype_maps(source_paths: List[str], dest_path: str,
                        conflict_resolution: str = "highest_confidence"):
    """
    Merge multiple phenotype maps into a single consolidated map.

    Args:
        source_paths: List of source map file paths
        dest_path: Destination file path
        conflict_resolution: How to handle conflicts ("highest_confidence", "OR_masks", "newest")
    """
    merged_data = {}

    for source_path in source_paths:
        with gzip.open(source_path, 'rb') as f:
            source_data = pickle.load(f)

        for address, entry in source_data.items():
            if address not in merged_data:
                merged_data[address] = entry.copy()
            else:
                # Apply conflict resolution strategy
                existing = merged_data[address]

                if conflict_resolution == "highest_confidence":
                    if entry.get('confidence', 0) > existing.get('confidence', 0):
                        merged_data[address] = entry.copy()

                elif conflict_resolution == "OR_masks":
                    existing['memory_mask'] |= entry['memory_mask']
                    existing['usage_count'] += entry.get('usage_count', 0)
                    existing['last_updated'] = max(
                        existing.get('last_updated', 0),
                        entry.get('last_updated', 0)
                    )

                elif conflict_resolution == "newest":
                    if entry.get('last_updated', 0) > existing.get('last_updated', 0):
                        merged_data[address] = entry.copy()

    # Save merged result
    dest_store = PickleStore(dest_path)
    dest_store.data = merged_data
    dest_store._save()
    dest_store.close()

    print(f"Merged {len(source_paths)} maps into {dest_path} "
          f"({len(merged_data)} total entries)")

```
