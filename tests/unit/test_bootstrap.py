"""
Test suite for the bootstrap protocol.

This module tests that actors properly wait for and respond to the
gyro_bootstrap signal, exiting their gating loop within the required
30-second timeout.

Expected imports when modules are available:
- from gyro_si.gyro_gcr.gyro_config import config
- from gyro_si.gyro_comm import send_message, MessageTypes
