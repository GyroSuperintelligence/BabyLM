"""
Test suite for tensor transaction safety.

This module tests that tensor state is properly snapshotted and restored
when transactions are aborted, ensuring atomic operations.

Expected imports when modules are available:
- from gyro_si.gyro_gcr.gyro_config import config
- from gyro_si.g1_gyroalignment.cs.identity import tensor_transaction
