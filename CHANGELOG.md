# Changelog

## [0.9.7] ‚Äì 2024-07-12
- Refactored InferenceEngine and InformationEngine to support efficient batch processing with a new process_batch() method and updated process_stream() for fast-path batching.
- Created a high-performance bulk trainer script (toys/learning/trainer.py) for large curriculum files, supporting batch updates, periodic checkpointing, and multi-format learning.
- Added preference flags for batch size and optional Numba JIT compilation for further speedup.
- Established a clean, two-step curriculum workflow:
  1. Curriculum Serialization: Script (toys/learning/threads/wordnet_curriculum_threads.py) serializes the entire WordNet database into a flat text file for training. Output now goes to toys/learning/threads/corpus/wordnet_corpus.txt.
  2. Model Training: The trainer script consumes the generated corpus file for fast, scalable learning.
- Restored and updated all curriculum format and thread generator scripts in toys/learning/formats/ and toys/learning/threads/ to use correct namespace UUIDs and implement pattern index cycling (degeneracy).
- Ensured all scripts are runnable with PYTHONPATH=. for proper import resolution.
- Rewrote learning update logic so all loaded formats are updated for each winning pattern index, enabling true multi-format associative learning and correct handling of degeneracy.
- Fixed all pyright type errors related to string/bytes handling and added targeted type ignore comments where necessary.
- Moved all generated and output files to appropriate subdirectories to avoid clutter and maintain a clean project structure.

## [0.9.6] ‚Äì 2025-07-11
- Enforced strict test isolation: all tests and engine code now use a dedicated test directory (`toys/health/memories/`).
- Standardized argument propagation: all helpers and engine methods now require and pass `prefs` and `base_memories_dir` as needed.
- Fixed critical bugs in `IntelligenceEngine` initialization and thread/gene key storage.
- Updated test mocks and assertions to match real function signatures, eliminating signature mismatch errors.
- Resolved all linter and static analysis issues; codebase is now clean and warning-free.
- Investigated and explained origins of stray test output and directory artifacts.
- Major performance and robustness improvements:
  - Added pattern matching cache to InferenceEngine for fast repeated lookups.
  - Implemented batch stream processing in InformationEngine with configurable batch size for efficient I/O.
  - Introduced robust, multi-process-safe registry caching with mtime-based invalidation.
  - Refactored PatternIndex to use defaultdict for cleaner and faster indexing.
  - Optimized IntelligenceEngine encode/decode logic with O(1) lookup maps supporting multiple patterns per character.
  - Simplified registry cache eviction logic for clarity and correctness.
- **Added new CLI suite under `toys/console/`:**
  - Interactive chat, dashboard, format viewer, and thread manager tools for BabyLM.
  - All CLI modules are type- and lint-clean, with robust error handling and safe type usage throughout.

- Refactored IntelligenceEngine to support multiple formats simultaneously, keyed by format_uuid.
- Updated all code and tests to use per-format access (self.formats[self.format_uuid]) instead of self.M.
- Fixed all test failures and ensured robust multi-format operation.
- Updated Genetics.md to clarify format access, pattern index cycling, and pattern distance matrix storage.
- Implemented stable UUIDs for public formats using uuid.uuid5 and a fixed namespace, enabling reproducible curriculum and format references.
- Fixed TypedDict access warnings for optional keys.

## [0.9.6] ‚Äì 2025-07-10
- Refactored private gene key storage to use per-record encryption with length prefix for true append-only performance.
- Public thread metadata is now updated only at finalization, not per event, for better performance.
- Moved tensor_to_output_byte to InferenceEngine for architectural clarity.
- Fixed AES key length validation to require 32 bytes (256 bits) for AES-256.
- Added registry file locking in shard_path to prevent race conditions during sharding.
- Switched recent_patterns to collections.deque(maxlen=256) for efficient context tracking.
- PatternIndex.find_similar_contexts now caps locations checked for common patterns to avoid performance bottlenecks.
- Removed redundant cryptography imports and local JSON helpers.
- Replaced brittle thread UUID checks with robust file existence checks.
- Refactored ThreadMetadata to use children: List[ChildRef] instead of parallel child_uuids/child_names; updated all code and tests accordingly.
- Improved TypedDict access safety and fixed pyright linter errors throughout the codebase.
- Unified privacy logic using an explicit 'privacy' field ('public'/'private') for threads and gene keys
- Replaced legacy XOR encryption with robust AES-GCM encryption for private threads, using per-thread derived keys
- Clarified and retained 'agent_uuid' in gene keys for agent association/ownership (not privacy)
- Refactored thread/gene key creation, storage, and tests to use the new privacy model
- Updated all relevant code and tests for clarity, security, and future extensibility
- Major revision of Genetics.md: fully integrated Common Governance Model (CGM) theory, mapping all system components to CGM stages (CS, UNA, ONA, BU)
- Clarified and formalized the dual nature of BU (Egress/Recollection and Ingress/Closure) in both documentation and code
- Updated all terminology to remove analogies (e.g., "physicist/linguist"), using only precise CGM language
- Ensured the spec and implementation match: _generate_response_byte now documented and implemented as a two-stage ONA/BU process using combined resonance and confidence
- Rewrote learning mechanisms section to reflect that confidence directly influences generation (BU closure), and removed outdated "attention mechanism" text
- Added a comprehensive glossary of all key terms (Epigenome, Genome, Egress, Ingress, ONA, BU, etc.)
- Fixed Pyright and linter errors in intelligence.py and babylm.py (indentation, type safety, buffer handling)

### Fixed
- Fixed a critical state management bug in `IntelligenceEngine` that caused duplicate or excessive gene key writes in public mode. State buffers are now always cleared after finalization, preventing data leaks between sessions in both public and private modes.
- Fixed inconsistent and incorrect file path logic for public thread and gene key storage, ensuring all files are created and written to the correct sharded locations.
- Fixed issues where public NDJSON files were not being created or written due to file handle and path errors.

### Improved
- Modernized and strengthened the test suite for public thread and gene key storage, ensuring robust detection of subtle bugs and regressions.
- Unified file path calculation logic for all public thread operations, improving maintainability and reliability.
- Ensured state buffers are always cleared after finalization, preventing data leaks between sessions in both public and private modes.
