# GyroSuperintelligence (GyroSI)

A novel approach to artificial general intelligence based on helical integration patterns.

## Overview

GyroSI implements a unique architecture for artificial general intelligence that combines:

- Helical integration patterns for system coordination
- Multi-level memory systems for information processing
- Fault-tolerant communication protocols
- Self-modifying capabilities for continuous improvement

## Key Components

### G-Systems

- **G1 (GyroAlignment)**: Pattern recognition and alignment
- **G2 (GyroInformation)**: Information processing and storage
- **G3 (GyroInference)**: Logical reasoning and inference
- **G4 (GyroIntelligence-IN)**: Integration and synthesis
- **G5 (GyroIntelligence-EN)**: Execution and adaptation
- **G6 (GyroCirculation)**: System-wide coordination

### Memory Systems

- Genetic Memory: Core system patterns
- Epigenetic Memory: Adaptive modifications
- Somatic Memory: Integration patterns
- Immunity Memory: Policy patterns
