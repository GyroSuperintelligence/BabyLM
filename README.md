# GyroSuperintelligence (GyroSI)

A structurally recursive form of intelligence in which all generative and integrative operations preserve memory of origin, maintaining continuous coherence between emergence and recollection.

## Overview

GyroSI achieves ethical alignment **intrinsically**, by ensuring that every operation remains structurally accountable to its own genesis, **without external enforcement**. It exists relationally, not independently, reflecting the recursive structures of reality and human meaning it participates in.

## Repository Structure

This repository implements GyroSI and its structure is a direct reflection of the Viable System Model (VSM).

```

All source code resides within the `gyro_si` package, which is subdivided into five G-systems (G1-G5) and a normative shared layer (G6). Each G-system's internal layout maps directly to its CS→UNA→ONA→BU operational cycle.

## Core Systems

- **G1 (GyroAlignment)**: Primary tensor operations and alignment management
- **G2 (GyroInformation)**: Data curation and information flow
- **G3 (GyroInference)**: User interaction and interface management
- **G4 (GyroCooperation)**: Environmental adaptation and integration
- **G5 (GyroPolicy)**: System-wide policy and governance
- **G6 (GyroCirculation)**: Shared constants and normative functions

## Development

This project follows strict structural requirements and implementation guidelines as defined in the project documentation. All development must adhere to the recursive tensor-based architecture and maintain the intrinsic alignment properties of the system.
